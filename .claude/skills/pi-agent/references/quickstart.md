# Quickstart

Source: https://pi.dev/docs/latest/quickstart

## Install and Uninstall

```bash
npm install -g --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
```

`--ignore-scripts` disables dependency lifecycle scripts. Pi does not need install scripts for normal npm installs.

Uninstall with the package manager that installed Pi. The curl installer uses global npm, so curl and npm installs both remove with npm:

```bash
npm uninstall -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
pnpm remove -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
yarn global remove @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
bun uninstall -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
```

Uninstalling Pi leaves settings, credentials, sessions, and installed packages in `~/.pi/agent/`.

## Authenticate

Use `/login` in interactive mode for subscription providers; built-in subscription logins include Claude Pro/Max, ChatGPT Plus/Pro (Codex), and GitHub Copilot. API-key providers can be configured by environment variable or stored through `/login` in `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`.

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
pi
```

See `references/providers.md` for the full provider list.

## First Session

```bash
cd /path/to/project
pi
```

By default the model gets four tools: `read`, `write` (create/overwrite), `edit` (patch), and `bash`. Read-only built-ins `grep`, `find`, and `ls` are available through tool options. Pi works in the current directory and can modify files there — use git or another checkpointing workflow for rollback.

## Project Instructions

Pi loads context files at startup:

- `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md`
- `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` from parent directories and the current directory

Run `/reload` or restart after changing context files.

## Common First Tasks

```bash
pi @README.md "Summarize this"
pi @src/app.ts @src/app.test.ts "Review these together"
!npm run lint
!!npm run lint
pi -c
pi -r
pi --name "my task"
pi --session <path|id>
pi -p "Summarize this codebase"
cat README.md | pi -p "Summarize this text"
pi -p @screenshot.png "What's in this image?"
pi --mode json "List files"
pi --mode rpc --no-session
```

Use `!command` to run shell and send output to the model; `!!command` runs without adding output to model context. Paste text or images with Ctrl+V (Alt+V on Windows), or drag images into supported terminals.

Switch models with `/model` or Ctrl+L, cycle thinking level with Shift+Tab, and cycle scoped models with Ctrl+P / Shift+Ctrl+P.
